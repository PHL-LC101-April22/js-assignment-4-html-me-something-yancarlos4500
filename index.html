            <h2>Flight Simulation</h2>
            <p>Flight Simulation has been my main hobby for about 10 years. I came across a copy of Flight Simulator 2004 while I was looking for an usb cable inside a basket. 
               I set it up and chose my home airport, Las Americas Intl in the Dominican Republic, as my starting point. I instantly fell in love with it and later found a community of simmers that would fly a virtual Dominican Airline. 
               I also joined a online aviation network called <a href="https://vatsim.net">VATSIM</a> that links flight simmers with Air Traffic Control Enthusiasts in a global online world. 
               Now 10 years later, I succesfully run a virtual airline called <a href="https://flyvblue.net">vBlue</a> which goal is to simulates Jetblue Airways operations as real as posible. Through out the years I met great people in this community and made Lifelong friends. </p>

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p id="testP">I love gaming. I was introduce to the gaming world when I was 5 years old. My uncle while living in the states, sent us a nintendo as a birthday present for me and my brothers. I used to wake up early on the weekends just so I can play Donkey Kong. Fast forward 18 years and I still enjoy playing
               From Simulators like Flight Sim and American Truck Simulator to Call of Duty and Halo, I still can't get enough of it. </p>
